# Minesweeper
This is the classic game of Minesweeper built on java. It imports the libraries of java.x and java.awt to build the graphical components and to also create the event listeners. I also utilized the libraries of a timer to get the exact replica. Additionally, I added my own twist by allowing the user to switch through different themes of the game, such as a clipart theme or a mario kart theme.
